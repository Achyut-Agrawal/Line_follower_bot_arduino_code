# Line_follower_bot_arduino_code
Arduino code for line follower robot
This code is based on Arduino and IR sensor in which IR transmitter will transmit a rays and IR receiver will receive the reflected rays and work accordingly.
Since black surface will not reflect so the arduino will command the sensor to move away from black line.

In this two IR sensor is placed on the either side of Black surface outside it so when ever any turns come IR sensor will come on the black surface and according to arduino it will move accordingly.
